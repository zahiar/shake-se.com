<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Finally, I have solved this mystery after a long time, I could not believe how simple the fix was.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This mystery is related to the Walkman phones, where the Walkman icon would disappear from the menu.</p>
<p>The cause of the issue is the name of the movieclip containing the walkman icon, so to fix it simply locate the following lines <strong>"var App8_"</strong> and replace them with</p>
<p><strong>var App8_IconName = "MEDIAPLAYER_DESKTOP_ICN";<br />
var App8_Text = "walkman";</strong></p>
<p>Also, make sure you rename your movieclip so it corresponds to the new icon name <strong>"MEDIAPLAYER_DESKTOP_ICN"</strong></p>
<p>Now simply test your menu and it should now work</p>
