The things you will need are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate CDA Generator by CodeClaw (<a href="/downloads/tutorials/debrand/Ultimate CDA Generator.zip">Click here to download</a>)</li>
<li>A2 uploader (<a href="/downloads/tutorials/a2uploader.zip">Click here to download</a>)</li>
<li>Sony Ericsson Update Service (<a href="/downloads/tutorials/seus.exe">Click here to download</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 1: Creating the CDA XML file</h3>
<ol>
<li>Run the Ultimate CDA Generator. If the program gives an error then you will need to have Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or higher installed on your computer</li>
<li>Select your phone's model by clicking the phone icon</li>
<li>Now select a region by clicking on the region icon (Select a generic one, if you would like to debrand)</li>
<li>Click the save icon, and select where you would like to save the "customize_upgrade.xml" file to</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Uploading the file onto your phone</h3>
<ol>
<li>Turn off your phone and take the battery out and then put it back in</li>
<li>Run the A2Uploader</li>
<li>Click the "FileSystem Tool" button</li>
<li>Hold the "C" button and connect the USB cable. If this doesn't work try holding buttons "2" and "5" together, instead of "C"</li>
<li>Now goto "/tpa/preset/custom"</li>
<li>Drag and drop the file "customize_upgrade.xml" onto the right panel of A2Uploader</li>
<li>Now click "Shutdown FS Manager" button</li>
<li>Disconnect the USB cable and turn on your phone</li>
<li>A "Please Wait" prompt will appear on your phone, wait until this disappears and turn off your phone</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Debranding your phone</h3>
<ol>
<li>Run the Sony Ericsson Update Service</li>
<li>Follow the instructions</li>
</ol>
<p>If everything went smoothly, enjoy your debranded phone</p>
