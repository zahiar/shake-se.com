<p>Hi neliz heres the wallpapers for Twente FC.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I went with a slighty different design to the one you gave me.I haven't test these I think they should work.The 2 music info files are also shake, these 2 files can someone make video and send it to me to show what it looks like in standby when your playing music.<br />
hrcak999 the card theme I was thinking what if you shake the card spins and gives a random card instead of sequence 2,3,4 etc what do you think?</p>
