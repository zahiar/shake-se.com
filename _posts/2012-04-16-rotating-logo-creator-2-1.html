<p>I have received some reports from users, that the program does not work, when you install Java 7, this is now fixed in the new version.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The SourceCode.fla file can be edited but I would advise <strong>against</strong> that, as everything is done by the program, leaving the SourceCode.fla file an empty shell!</p>
<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> change the actionscript or any variable names or delete anything, as this will break the rotating logo, and it <strong>WILL NOT</strong> work!</p>
<p>Also, you cannot export the logo using Adobe Flash, as some of the actionscript is missing, therefore use the program to create the rotating logo for you.</p>
<h3>Please Note:</h3>
<p>The program will launch Adobe Flash and it will close it down after the rotating logo is exported, the rotating logo will be in the folder you chose to save it in, with the name you specified.</p>
