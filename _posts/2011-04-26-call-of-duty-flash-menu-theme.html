<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Here is a customisable flash menu and theme for the Flash Lite 3.x phones including the Sony Ericsson Aino.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The text "Call of Duty" in the flash menu can be changed to any text you want(12 characters limit), so for example you could put your name there. If you would like to put your own text there, just leave a comment, and I'll be more than happy to do it for you :)</p>
<p>This menu will also rotate with the phone</p>
