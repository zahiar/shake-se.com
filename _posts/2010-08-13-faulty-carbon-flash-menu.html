<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Here's another flash menu for flash lite 1/2/3 phones.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This menu(fl1.x) has a trick up its sleeve, which is when you highlight the icons quickly, they will stay highlighted, just highlight them again to turn them back to their original colour. This should keep you entertained whilst waiting for the bus or when you're bored, as you can make little patterns or something.</p>
<p>This menu is untested, so let me know if it works or not and I'll try and fix it, thanks</p>
