<p>The infamous sliding tux is back with his own flash menu. The tux slides down with an icon following him.</p>

<p>Added a matching theme to go with the menu, and this was kindly created by AquaVinka</p>
<h3>Update (01-21-2011):</h3>
<p>The flash menu has been updated to support flash lite 3.x</p>
