<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The Xshake wallpaper has been improved to support png,jpg,gif,bmp format pictures.</span></p>

<p>Plus the limit of pictures that you use has been set to 100 for each file format (ie 100 png, 100 jpg etc) it takes a bit of time loading when you don't have enough pictures.The gif will only load as static because of flash.Finally working on a file where you load your own pictures for floating in next couple of days.</p>
