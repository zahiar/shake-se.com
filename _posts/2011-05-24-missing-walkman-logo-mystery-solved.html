<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This is a common error I came across when converting Flash Lite 3 menus to Flash Lite 2. The menus would only show the Cyber-shot logo and not the Walkman one.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>In the newer menus there is only 1 camera icon, as opposed to 2, therefore the code needs to be changed slightly to accommodate this, unless you go ahead and create a separate icon for non Cyber-shot phones, and modify the code to accommodate the new icon, alternatively you can take a shortcut :)</p>
<p>Just replace the line beginning with <strong>for (beginning of the for loop)</strong> in the <strong>checkPhoneType()</strong> function with this line:</p>
<p><strong>for (i = 11; i >= 0; i--)</strong></p>
<p>The line makes it check for a Walkman phone first, then it checks for a Cyber-shot phone. This is because, Walkman phones use the same camera icon as Cyber-shot phones, which resulted in the previous code recognising every phone as a Cyber-shot.</p>
<p>Now simply test your menu and it should now work</p>
