<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Here's a sneak peek at the new site, which will have several new features.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We are in the process of redesigning the website, to make it easier for you to use, we have introduced a lot of new features such as easier navigation and adding the ability to link it with facebook. Here's a run down of some of the features:</p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p><img class="centre" alt="Naivgation Preview" src="/downloads/news/shake-se2-prev3.jpg" width="460px" height="107px" /></p>
<p>Now, you can easily access the content you want, and the dropdown menus will allow you to select the content you want to see.</p>
<h3>Social Networking</h3>
<p><img class="centre" alt="Social Links Preview" src="/downloads/news/shake-se2-prev1.jpg" width="203px" height="38px" /></p>
<p>On every page, you will see these icons, which let you link to that page via your facebook, twitter, etc account.</p>

<p>If you like something, then click the like button and let your friends know on facebook, what you like, and you can see what you're friends like aswell.</p>
<h3>Suggestions Page</h3>
<p>Since i get users on the site requesting menus, wallpapers, etc or even giving me ideas, so i decided to create a page where you can list what you want, and i will have a go at doing it. This way, you can get exactly what you want.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions about the new website, then let me know<br />
Thanks</p>
