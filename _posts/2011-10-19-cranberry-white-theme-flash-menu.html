<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Another requested theme which is similar to the Apple White posted earlier, except it now has a gorgeous red and white colour scheme</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This simple flash menu has been modified to include the Calendar icon, which is not shown on some Flash Lite 3.x phones. This flash menu will work on all Flash Lite 2/3 phones.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Shanth, for providing me with the flash menu &amp; theme</p>
<p>Think you've seen the text above before, perhaps it was on the Apple White theme page? :P</p>
