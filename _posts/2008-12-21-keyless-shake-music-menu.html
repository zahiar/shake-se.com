<p>Heres a menu where I have changed the icons.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>When you go onto the menu you should here some music, plus the icons should follow the phone in same direction which ever way you point it. It works the same as the first 2 menus created so far. I need some feedback do you people prefer the original icons in menus or would you like to see different icons? Plus how are you getting on with the menu being keyless?</p>
