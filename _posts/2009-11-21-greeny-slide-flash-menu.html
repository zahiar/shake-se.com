<p>Greeny slide with password protection.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This menu was provided by mayaman42. I just modified it so it has the password protection feature. The menu only works on flash lite 2.0 phones, EG k850/w910i.</p>
<h3>Update: 06-12-2010</h3>
<p>I have created a version for flash lite 2.1 now due to requests. I haven't tested it as i haven't got a flash lite 2.1 phone. I have also put up its source code, so all the flash developers can look at it and use it for their own stuff.</p>
<h3>Update: 06-19-2011</h3>
<p>I have created a version for flash lite 3.0 now due to requests. It is untested, as I do not have a flash lite 3.0 phone.</p>
