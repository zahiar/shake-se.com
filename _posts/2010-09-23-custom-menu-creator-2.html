<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Its finally here, Custom Menu Creator 2 will allow you to fully customise your menu for your phone.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Since so many people liked the previous Custom Menu Creator, I decided to build an updated version with features requested by them such as the ability to use different Adobe Flash versions and the ability to change backgrounds and icons.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots</p>

<p>When you first run the program, you will be presented with a list of things you need to have. Also, if you get stuck there is a built-in help.</p>
<p>The SourceCode.fla file can be edited but I would advise <strong>against</strong> that, as everything is done by the program, leaving the SourceCode.fla file an empty shell!</p>
<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> change the actionscript or any variable names or delete any thing, as this will break the menu, and the menu <strong>WILL NOT</strong> work!</p>
<p>Also, you cannot export the menu using Adobe Flash, as some of the actionscript is missing and the background image and icons are missing, therefore use the program to create the menu for you.</p>
<h3>Please Note:</h3>
<p>The program will launch Adobe Flash and it will close it down after the menu is exported, the menu will be in the folder you chose to save it in, with the name you specified</p>
