<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I was having coffee with a mate of mine who has a purple w810i, she always wanted a pass protected menu with her own passcode. And since no-one has created customised menus with a user's pass code (AFAIK), therefore i created this.</span></p>

<h3>Update (08-08-2010):</h3>
<p>Due to requests, I have created a 240x320 resolution, of this menu. I can't test it as I don't have any flash lite 1.x phone. If it doesn't work, then let me know.</p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>This is the source code for the flash menu, and need Adobe Flash CS3 or above, to work with.</p>
