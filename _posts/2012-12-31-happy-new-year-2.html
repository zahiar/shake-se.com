<p>This past year has been an interesting one and here's a quick list of our most notable achievements:</p><!--more-->
<p>*) 14th January, we celebrated Shake-SE.com's 4th birthday, by releasing our <a href="/2012/01/14/facebook-theme-flash-menu/">Facebook Theme &amp; Flash Menu</a>, as well as launching an <a href="https://www.customlivewallpapercreator.com/">Android version</a> of our site (An update will be announced on Shake-SE.com's 5th birthday)</p>
<p>*) 25th February, we released our most anticipated and most downloaded flash menu of the year, the <a href="/2012/02/25/iphone-theme-flash-menu/">iPhone Flash Menu &amp; Theme</a></p>
<p>*) 10th March, we added our entire history onto our <a href="/2012/03/10/facebook-page-timeline/">Facebook Timeline</a>, so you can see how Shake-SE.com has progressed over the years, as well as knowing how it all began</p>
<p>*) 13th March, for the first time, we released 7 themes in one go</p>
<p>Next year, I'm going to be busy with school assignments as it's my final year but I will try to spend some time on making stuff for you guys.</p>
<p>We want to take this opportunity to say thank you for your continued patience and support over the past year, as you guys are the ones who keep this site running.</p>
<p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
