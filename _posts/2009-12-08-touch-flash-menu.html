<p>Touch modified to add password protection.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This menu was provided by shaher. I just modified it so it has the password protection feature. I'm not sure what flash lite version this menu is for, sorry :(.</p>
<h3>Update (12-22-2009):</h3>
<p>I have created a flash lite 2.0 version of this menu has some people wanted this. If you have any problems then let me know<br />
Thanks</p>
<h3>Update (12-24-2009):</h3>
<p>I fixed the menu so it now enters the correct icon, as reported by w890i. If you have any more problems then let me know<br />
Thanks</p>
