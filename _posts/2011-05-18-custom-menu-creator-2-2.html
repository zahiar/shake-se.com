<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The updated version of Custom Menu Creator, fixes an important bug regarding the Walkman icon.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>After receiving many reports of flash menus not displaying the missing Walkman icon, I have finally fixed it.</p>
<p>The SourceCode.fla and SourceCodeAino.fla files can be edited but I would advise <strong>against</strong> that, as everything is done by the program, leaving the SourceCode(Aino).fla file an empty shell!</p>
<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> change the actionscript or any variable names or delete any thing, as this will break the menu, and the menu <strong>WILL NOT</strong> work!</p>
<p>Also, you cannot export the menu using Adobe Flash, as some of the actionscript is missing and the background image and icons are missing, therefore use the program to create the menu for you.</p>
<h3>Please Note:</h3>
<p>The program will launch Adobe Flash and it will close it down after the menu is exported, the menu will be in the folder you chose to save it in, with the name you specified</p>
