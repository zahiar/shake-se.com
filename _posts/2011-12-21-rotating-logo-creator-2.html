<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The Rotating Logo Creator, has finally been updated!</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Due to the popularity of the previous Rotating Logo Creator, I decided to update it with new features such as the ability to use different Adobe Flash versions and a more easier to use interface.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots</p>

<p>When you first run the program, you will be presented with a list of things you need to have. Also, if you get stuck there is a built-in help.</p>
<p>The SourceCode.fla file can be edited but I would advise <strong>against</strong> that, as everything is done by the program, leaving the SourceCode.fla file an empty shell!</p>
<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> change the actionscript or any variable names or delete anything, as this will break the rotating logo, and it <strong>WILL NOT</strong> work!</p>
<p>Also, you cannot export the logo using Adobe Flash, as some of the actionscript is missing, therefore use the program to create the rotating logo for you.</p>
<h3>Please Note:</h3>
<p>The program will launch Adobe Flash and it will close it down after the rotating logo is exported, the rotating logo will be in the folder you chose to save it in, with the name you specified</p>
